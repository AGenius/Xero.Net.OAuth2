# Xero.Net2.OAuth2
This is a .NET Framework version of the official XeroAPI/Net-Standard SDK that provides access to the Xero OAuth2 API

This exists because I found some issues using the official API and binding sources in my .NET Framework applications. 

When testing and creating a .Net Framework version of the NetStandard SDK I found the binding sources worked perfectly.

I have now made this version which is a complete merge of the NetStandard code base and my OAuth2 Wrapper code.

I have left all the NetStandard code public so you can use either the new Wrapper elements via Xero.Net.Core or the Xero.Net.Api.Api

This Wrapper is exposed as Xero.Net.Core and Xero.
